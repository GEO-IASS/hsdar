- New functionalities (suggested and supported by André Große-Stoltenberg):
  - Function for soil indices implemented (soilindex)

  - Gaussian model on soil spectra implemented (Special thanks to Michael Whiting 
    for providing his IDL code and helping on the development of the FORTRAN implemention)
- Bug fixes:
  - transform_speclib: The bugs only affected the continuum hull
